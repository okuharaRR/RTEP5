# MyTea - The perfect cuppa, every time

Welcome to the MyTea github page - the tea making machine which brings you the perfect tea experience!

_A Raspberry PI will be used to control the entire process of tea preparation. Depending on the tea chosen by the user, the system will heat up water to the required temperature, dispense the required amount of tea leaves into a filter, infuse the leaves for a specified time, and finally pour the tea into a cup._

_With so many coffee machines available to satisfy every variety of coffee that anyone has ever came up with, this product aims to deliver the ultimate tea experience in an office environment or a public institution so that tea drinkers are not left at the mercy of the primitive old kettle..._

## Installation

On the terminal of a Raspberry Pi type the following:

```git clone https://github.com/okuharaRR/RTEP5.git```

```cd TeaMaker```

```qmake```

```make```

```./TeaMaker```

[Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) and [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) are required.

If ```make``` gives an error, try ```make clean``` first and ```make```.

## Using the application

Once a finished product is made, using it will be straightforward:

1. Fill up the kettle with water and make sure the switch in the back is in the ON position. (_The need for a mechanical switch is for user safety_.)
2. Fill up the dispenser with tea leaves.
3. Once done, turn on the RPI and launch the GUI application.
4. Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/okuharaRR/RTEP5/wiki/User-Manual).

That's it!
